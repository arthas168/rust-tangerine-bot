# rust-tangerine-bot
🍊 🤖 🦀

A Rust program that sends a request to fetch data from a Heroku server,
then composes a message off the back of that data, and finally sends it to a
recipient in Facebook Messenger. The FB API part is covered by this project - https://github.com/arthas168/fb_messenger_rust,
and is deployed to crates.io so other users can use it if they need to (https://crates.io/crates/fb_messenger)
